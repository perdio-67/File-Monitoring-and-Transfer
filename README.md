#Folder Monitoring and Transfering 2024 

the objective of this application is a quick and effecient way of semi integrating systems together where one system is programmed to save certain files in a specfic folder, 
this console servie will monitor that folder att all times and once any new file was added will be moved to any folder chosen within the network with suffecient permission automatically. 

This was a qucik solution for a project i worked on as due to some limitation the Deployed software wasn't able to save files outside the hosted machine.
